The following questions are in response to a large fortune 500 company. 

# Glossery:
Automation = Automated testing that is generally triggered as part of a 
Continious Integration (CI) process.

Automated testing = Testing code that asserts expected behavior from a main
application ranging from asserts of smaller units of logic (unit tests), to 
integration tests (ie: API tests), to larger tests that assert user journeys 
(ie: UI tests).


# Questions

1. When would you plan/start automation for a project? What would be your
pre-requisites?


Given my above definition of automation ( see #Glossery ), one should start
thinking of automated testing as early as possible in the project.
